# react-native-immediate-phone-call
Initiate immediate phone call (without further user interaction) for React Native on iOS and Android.
The difference with [react-native-phone-call](https://github.com/tiaanduplessis/react-native-phone-call) and [react-native-communications](https://github.com/anarchicknight/react-native-communications) is that with this library no additional user input is required for Android and the call starts instantly (Apple always asks confirmation since the last iOs updates...). 

NOTICE:
- for React Native < 0.47 use react-native-immediate-phone-call <1.x.x
- for React Native > 0.47 use react-native-immediate-phone-call >=1.x.x
